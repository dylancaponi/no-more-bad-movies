There are enough "good" movies (and TV shows) in the world that you should never have to watch a "bad" one if you don't want to.

But where exactly is the cutoff between good and bad?

Well that depends on how much longer you plan to live and how much content you watch per day.

It also depends on how much media you've *already* consumed.

Let's say you're 30, you watch 1hr of content per day, and you'll die at 80.

That's 18,250hours of media consumption remaining in your life.

As of 2022 there are already 72,391 hours of content.

I predict ~422,000 more hours of content created in your lifetime based on a polynomail fit of total hours of content produced per year.

(AI media generation will surely wreck this prediction)

So if you want to watch only the top content in your lifetime, what should the rating cutoff be?
